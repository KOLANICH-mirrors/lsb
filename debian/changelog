lsb (1.2-5.woody.1) stable; urgency=high

  * Support LSB 1.2 in woody.  Includes all changes through 1.2-6 in sid.
  * Fix call to shadowconfig in postinst.  (Closed: #166041)
  * Add text to the debconf template that lets the user know that shadow
    passwords are not needed by most LSB applications.
  * Remove duplicate --retry 5 from start-stop-daemon call.  (Closed: #165395)
  * Fix bugs in the init script registry code.  (Closed: #165038)
  * Support more specifications for the signal in "killproc".
    (Closed: #163109)
  * Return non-zero exit status if "pidofproc" can't find the process.
    (Closed: #157314)
  * Fix silly typos in install_initd.  (Closed: #152544)
  * Fix duplicated --retry 5.  (Closed: #152552)
  * Added support for facilities introduced in gLSB 1.2.  (Closed: #148568)
    - $time: start >= S24, stop <= K21
    - $portmap: start >= S19, stop <= K34
  * Removed support for the $netdaemons facility, which vanished from the
    specification.  Hopefully nobody is using it...
  * Call pidof if it's available and /var/run/$1.pid doesn't exist.

lsb (1.1.0-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Note that Debian's run-parts ignores certain lsb cron.* scripts, in
    violation of the LSB specification.  See #118646.
    (If necessary, run-parts may be diverted by this package to conform.)

  * Force removal of rc.d links in remove_initd.  (Closes: #139400)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Mar 2002 22:43:01 -0600

lsb (1.1.0-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improve error handing in {install,remove}_initd when no argument is
    specified.
  * Fix minor syntax error in outputing the facilities file.
  * Move facilities file handling into the initdutils module.
  * Changed facilities file format to allow multiple init scripts to
    provide the same facility w/o crashing.
  * These changes should solve all the init script handing bugs; thanks to
    Tobias Burnus <tburnus@physik.fu-berlin.de> for his testing.

lsb (1.1.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include /usr/X11R6/bin to make the LSB test suite happy.  Document
    LSB's lack of specification of an X server or any clients as required
    for compliance (hence making it odd that /usr/X11R6/bin would be
    needed, as it could conceivably be empty).  (Closes: #136713)
  * Prompt on installation if shadow passwords appear to be disabled, and
    enable them if requested.  (Closes: #136806)
  * Fix the spelling of Matt Taggart's name in README.Debian.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Mar 2002 23:19:39 -0600

  * Update README.Debian and install_initd to implement a few changes:
    - uid/gid for bin is documented.
    - treat RL 2-5 as the same, because nothing else sensible seems
      available.
