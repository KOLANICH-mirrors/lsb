Description: Linux Standard Base 4.0 core support package
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.
 .
 This package provides an implementation of the core of version 4.0 of
 the Linux Standard Base for Debian on the Intel x86, Intel ia64
 (Itanium), IBM S390, and PowerPC 32-bit architectures with the Linux
 kernel. Future revisions of the specification and this package may
 support the LSB on additional architectures and kernels.
 .
 The intent of this package is to provide a best current practice way
 of installing and running LSB packages on Debian GNU/Linux. Its
 presence does not imply that Debian fully complies
 with the Linux Standard Base, and should not be construed as a
 statement that Debian is LSB-compliant.

Description: Linux Standard Base version reporting utility
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.
 .
 The lsb-release command is a simple tool to help identify the Linux
 distribution being used and its compliance with the Linux Standard Base.
 LSB conformance will not be reported unless the required metapackages are
 installed.
 .
 While it is intended for use by LSB packages, this command may also
 be useful for programmatically distinguishing between a pure Debian
 installation and derived distributions.
