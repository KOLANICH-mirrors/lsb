<H2>LSB as it relates to Debian</H2>
This document compares the <A HREF="http://www.linuxbase.org/spec/">LSB written specification</A> to Debian. This changes on a continual basis so check the date at the bottom for when this comparison was last updated. This is a work in progress. Please point out any errors you may find.<BR>

<H3>Required by the Specification</H3>
First we review the spec and see what that means in terms of Debian packages.
<UL>
<LI>Mapping of <A HREF="LSBtoDEB">LSB to Debian packages</A>[1]<BR>
<LI>Mapping of those <A HREF="DEBtoLSB">Debian packages back to the LSB</A>[2]<BR>
<LI><A HREF="deblist">List</A>[3] of Debian packages required by LSB<BR>
</UL>
<H3>Creating a Debian system plus LSB</H3>
Now that we know what packages the spec requires we
<OL>
<LI>Install a "base" Debian system(including everything "required" by Debian).<BR>
This results in,
<UL>
<LI>the <A HREF="freshinstall">following</A>[4] packages on the system
<LI><A HREF="fresh.common">these</A>[5] are in common with [3].
<LI><A HREF="fresh.new">these</A>[6] are in the LSB but not on the system
<LI><A HREF="fresh.extra">these</A>[7] are on the system but not in LSB
</UL>
<LI>Now install the packages from [3] that aren't already installed(which were identified above as [6])
<LI>Allow all dependencies of those packages to be fulfilled<BR>
This results in,
<UL>
<LI>the <A HREF="superset">following</A>[8] packages on the system
<LI>the entire list([3]) of Debian packages required by LSB have been installed
<LI><A HREF="super.extra">this</A>[9] is the list of packages on the system but not in LSB
</UL>
</OL>
<H3>Observations</H3>
<UL>
<LI>List [8] is <A HREF="superset">The Debian LSB Sample Implementation</A>
<LI>[7] is <A HREF="fresh.extra">the list of packages that Debian considers "Required, Important, and Standard" which are not in the LSB</A>. Some of these may deserve consideration for a future version of the LSB.
<LI>[8] minus [4] yields <A HREF="needed">the packages needed in the Debian base install to make it more LSB compliant</A>[10]
<LI>[9] minus [7] yields <A HREF="depends">the packages pulled in as dependencies as a result of adding [6] to the system</A>[11]
</UL>
